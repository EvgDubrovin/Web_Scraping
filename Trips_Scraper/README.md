# Busines Trips Scraper

Here are 2 scripts I made for quick search of best flight and train tickets for my business trips made with Selenium. 

We only need to set up parameters for our trip - destination, date and desired arrival time - and run the script. As a result we get the ordering pages where we only need to fill the forms with our personal data and make a purchase. The whole process takes about 1 minute.

Set destination and date also get written into Excel report file.
